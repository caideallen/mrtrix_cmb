I will come back and fix this I swear to god

0_pipeline is what I acutally used for the data. 

MAYHEM is a combination of all the chaotic drafts/ways to send myself code while tunnling into the supercomputer. It all concerns the pipeline, not everything else I needed to do
Group Folders is all the miscellanious nitty-gritty stuff. File transfer, how I organized the group folders, basically how I managed all the data.

This pipeline uses 215 DWI images taken blah blah blah find out the specifics of the scanner and the other crap. Ask EO if I should/can include scan paramaters in here.
