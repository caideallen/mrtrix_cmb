0_pipeline is what I acutally used for the data. The rest was chaotic drafts and ways to send myself code while tunnling into the supercomputer. In my defense this is my Master's thesis and I got my bachelors in psychology, so I didnt exactly know shit about coding before this.

This pipeline uses 215 DWI images taken blah blah blah find out the specifics of the scanner and the other crap. Ask EO if I should/can include scan paramaters in here.
